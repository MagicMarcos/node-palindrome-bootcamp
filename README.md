# Palindrome Checker

<p> A fullstack application that checks if the passed in text is a palindrome by building a simple api. The logic for checking this is done in the backend </p>

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized: </p> 
    <ul> 
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>

<p>Users are able to pass in a word, number or phrase and the program will return a boolean determining whether it was palindrome.<p/>

<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>Through building this app, I was able to learn more about building API's and using core node</p>

<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>As someone with no background in art, styling could definitely use improvements.</p>
<p>Optimize CSS</p>
<p>Some of the code needs to refactored for better readability. </p>
